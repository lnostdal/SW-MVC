  (:documentation "
This metaclass enables slot access to have CELL-like features.

Initialization of unbound slots has one special property; if initialized with a
pointer (MK-PTR or #&) pointing to a CELL, that CELL will be used to represent
the slot value. The Î»f reader macro can be used to construct a CELL wrapped in
a pointer easily.

If a pointer is to be stored as a value, just wrap it in another pointer.

The CELL-OF macro allows one to refer directly to a CELL used to represent a
slot:

    (cell-of (slot-value some-object 'some-slot)) => #<CELL ...>

    (setf (cell-of (slot-value some-object 'some-slot))
          :replace-the-cell-itself)


This will also work for accessor methods (i.e., not just SLOT-VALUE)."))
