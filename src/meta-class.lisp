#| TODO: I'm wondering if this :WEAKNESS stuff is a bit more flexible than I
need most of the time. I suspect it'll add quite a bit of overhead,
eventually. |#


#| This stuff is too specific. There should be two hash-tables, EQ and EQUAL
based as now, but stuff here shouldn't assume we're working on or vs. CLOS
instances only. I.e., it should be generalized and talk about \"memory
locations\" or resources in the abstract. |#

#| TODO
It would be nice to have an API that would enable one to "chain" hash-tables
like this more easily. Making :weakness and :test configurable on a pr.
link (hash-table) basis would be great.
