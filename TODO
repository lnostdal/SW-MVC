  Grep for "TODO"...

  I don't think CELLs and FORMULAs "know about" unbound-ness at the moment.
I'm not sure it even makes sense for them to deal with this in some way or
another. Oz seems to have some blocking, wrt. reading/requesting thread, scheme
wrt. variables that are still unbound.


  I think a query language (something Prolog'ish or SQL'ish?) is needed soon. SW-DB?


  Add automatic parallelism support.
