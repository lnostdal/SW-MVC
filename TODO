  I don't think CELLs and FORMULAs "know about" unbound-ness at the moment.
I'm not sure it even makes sense for them to deal with this in some way or another.


  It is starting to become clear that the CELL class is the core component here.
I.e., even compound objects or CLOS classes with multiple slots should just
store one CELL pr. slot -- instead of what is currently being done wrt. any
MVC-CLASS metaclass's slots are "cells" including the CELL class itself as is
with its VALUE slot.

To hide the indirection for each slot, we'll just let the MVC-CLASS metaclass's
SVUC method handle slots with CELLs in them by deref'ing their content.

I think this means that CELL should be a struct; not a CLOS class - and I think
this'll both make things simpler and improve performance.

I think this change can wait though. I can just use things as they are now;
changing things later should be easy.
