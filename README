SW-MVC - Dataflow paradigm support for Common Lisp
==================================================

Dataflow, declarative or "cell oriented" (think spreadsheets) paradigm
and lazy-eval support for Common Lisp.

  * Input-triggered Cells: λi or #λ
  * Output-triggered Cells ("lazy eval"): λo
  * Output-triggered Cells ("lazy eval") with caching of result: λc


See examples/test.lisp or stuff in the tests/ directory.



Special characters and Emacs
============================

It might be a good idea to add something to your .emacs so typing λ will be easier. E.g.,

  (global-set-key (kbd "M-l") "λ")


I have λ assigned to Shift-Caps Lock.



Status
======

Alpha. See the TODO file.
