SW-MVC - Dataflow paradigm support for Common Lisp
==================================================

Dataflow, declarative or "cell oriented" (think spreadsheets) paradigm
and lazy-eval support for Common Lisp.

  * Input-triggered cells: λI, #λ or MK-ICELL.

  * Output-triggered cells ("lazy eval"): λO or MK-OCELL

  * Output-triggered cells ("lazy eval") with caching of result: λC or MK-CCELL


See examples/test.lisp or stuff in the tests/ directory.



Special characters and Emacs
============================

It might be a good idea to add something to your .emacs so typing λ will be
easier. E.g.,

  (global-set-key (kbd "M-l") "λ")


I have λ assigned to Shift-Caps Lock.

If you wish, you can instead use the normal lispy syntax; MK-ICELL, MK-OCELL
and MK-CCELL.



Status

Alpha. See the TODO file.
